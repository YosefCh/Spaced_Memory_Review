class SpacedMemoryReview:
    """
    A spaced repetition learning and review system for managing and recalling learned material.

    This class implements a comprehensive spaced repetition system that helps users learn and review
    content effectively over time. It manages the creation, storage, and scheduled review of learning
    materials including text, screenshots, and web links.

    Attributes:
        single_files_path (str): Path to store individual learning material files
        review_files_path (str): Path to store compiled review files
        data_file (str): Path to the CSV file storing learning material metadata
        screenshot_path (str): Path where screenshots are saved
        styles (str): Path to CSS file for styling HTML output
        browser_path (str): Primary browser path for opening review files
        backup_browser_path (str): Secondary browser path if primary fails
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing learning material records
        screenshot_function_called (bool): Flag indicating if screenshot function was used
        ai (OpenAIClient): Instance of OpenAI client for AI-assisted operations

    The system follows these key principles:
    1. Material is stored with metadata including subject, topic, and date
    2. Reviews are scheduled at increasing intervals (1, 7, 30, 90 days, etc.)
    3. Content is presented in HTML format with consistent styling
    4. Multiple types of content (text, images, links) are supported
    
    Methods
    -------
